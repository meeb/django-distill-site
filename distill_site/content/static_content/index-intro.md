**django-distill** is an open source, MIT licenced static site generator
library for the Django web development framework and is designed to integrate
into existing Django projects to allow some, or all of the content in the site
to be written out as static pages. Integration is simple and the level of
static site generation is up to the project. **django-distill** integrates with
Django, rather than requiring projects to be written for **django-distill**.

**django-distill** can be used to build simple static pages, blogs with
irregularly updated content or full complex JAM-stack websites with dynamic
APIs. Your sites can retain full, modern site features such as database backed
content, the full power of the Django CMS and admin as well as optional add-on
features like SASS/LESS CSS compilation all while retaining full static site
generation.

Once **django-distill** has been integrated to your Django project you can
export a static version of your project to a local directory, use a simple
management command to automatically publish your site to a CDN bucket like S3,
Google Cloud Files or Azure Blob Storage or even integrate your site to be
automatically built and deployed on repository push to a static site hosting
service like Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub pages and more.
