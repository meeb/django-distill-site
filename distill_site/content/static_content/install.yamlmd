This page covers how to add **django-distill** to your Django project.


# Step 1: Have a Django project

**django-distill** is an add-on library to Django, so you must already have a
Django project with working URLs to add it to. This guide assumes you already
know some basics around how to develop sites with Django. If not, please read
the excellent [getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)
documentation.

Once you have an existing Django with some working pages you install
**django-distill**.


# Step 2: Install django-distill

The easiest way to install **django-distill** is from PyPI via `pip`:

    $ pip install django-distill

You can use Python virtual environments (venvs), pipenv, poetry or whatever
Python package manager setup works for you.


# Step 3: Add to your project

Add `django_distill` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` of your
Django project:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... Django project apps here ...
        'django_distill',
        # ... local site apps here ...
    ]

That's it!

Now **django-distill** is added to your Django project you can begin with
